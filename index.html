                <p>
                    I'm a bit of a digital product junky. Over the years, I've
                    used hundreds of web and mobile apps in different industries
                    and verticals. Eventually, I decided that it would be a fun
                    challenge to try designing and building my own.

                <p>
                    I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any
                    simple website. I can even teach my grandma how to make
                    simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn
                    advanced topics.

                    <p>
                        I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know
                        everything needed to make a website function, efficient.
                        I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most
                        popular Javascript library called React JS. I even know
                        the deployment, server and security. I will give you
                        100% web solution. Just kidding ...

                    <p>
                        I possess a high level of proficiency in HTML, CSS, and
                        Javascript, encompassing the necessary skills to create
                        functional and optimized websites. However, let's not
                        take things too seriously – while I strive to deliver
                        the best results, claiming absolute mastery would be an
                        exaggeration.
